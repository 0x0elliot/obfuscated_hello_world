# obfuscated hello world
An on-going project where I try to obfuscate hello world program as much as possible. It's obfuscated but in a single line. The idea is trying to fit in as much obfuscation as possible in a single line of code.
<hr>

<h2>One line version:</h2>



```
  
python3 -c "exec(__import__('requests').get('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x0elliot/obfuscated_hello_world/main/helloworld.py').text);"
  
```
