# obfuscated hello world
An on-going project where I try to obfuscate hello world program as much as possible. It's obfuscated but in a single line. It's a simple concept so i will leave that there.
<hr>
## One line version:



<code>
  
python3 -c "exec(__import__('requests').get('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0x0elliot/obfuscated_hello_world/main/helloworld.py').text);"
  
</code>
